#### Description

I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead? You can download the challenge files here:

- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_atlas/14/challenge.zip)

The same files are accessible via SSH here: `ssh -p 55273 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net` Using the password `84b12bae`. Accept the fingerprint with `yes`, and `ls` once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!
